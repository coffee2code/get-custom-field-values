# Get Custom Field Values

A plugin for WordPress that provides widgets, shortcodes, and template tags to easily retrieve and display custom field values for posts or pages.


## Installation

1. Install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer. Or install the plugin code inside the plugins directory for your site (typically `/wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
3. Use the provided widget or the `c2c_linkify_authors()` template tag in one of your templates (be sure to pass it at least the first argument indicating what author IDs and/or slugs to linkify -- the argument can be an array, a space-separate list, or a comma-separated list). Other optional arguments are available to customize the output.
